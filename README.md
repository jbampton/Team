Passionate coder with a background in Business & Administration; seeker of new challenges, new problems to solve and new ways to test and hone my skills; **puzzle-solver for a living**.

A **teacher** at heart, I had been fortunate enough to pass what little I know to many people, thanks to my professional and **volunteer** activity. Interested in both corporate and start-up work experiences.
