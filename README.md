### Founder, CTO and Lead Programmer :neckbeard: :guardsman::muscle::muscle::fist::fist::facepunch::facepunch::boom::boom::point_up:

- [The Real Beast](https://www.codewars.com/users/Beast) - Steak or Streak, ECC RAM Style :cancer:

John has worked on a number of projects for me over the past **three years**. His contributions have been **significant** to the successful deployment of an **enterprise** document publishing system. His skills in **XSLT**, **XSD** and **XML**, **Ruby** and **Python**, combine with a **design approach** that results in **compact** and **agile** code. His **"outside-the-box"** solutions have also proven their worth with ongoing maintenance and support.

### Software Engineer, GitHub Developer Maintainer ðŸ–´

September 2018 â€“ Present. Iran. ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡·

**Max** is a software engineer or maybe just a programmer, a **GitHub Developer** maintainer, and so far creator of **The One programming language**.
His life is mostly as a `computer lover` with a focus on `compiler` and `programming languages`, since he has tested most of the languages and tools. `Max` has amazing experience in web development and software design. His educational background is in the **mathematics** field at the [University of Kashan](https://github.com/KashanIT). Max is a mathematical user because he has connected to the community of CE and CS students as well as the GitHub community.

You may think why does a mathematical student and person work in computer science ? Yes it may be a bit strange. 
`Max` also researches with professors of the university, attends science conferences (If he finds some time, since he is mostly busy with Open-Source projects) and his mission is to combine mathematics science with the computer. Anyway, `Max` is a programmer and not a mathematician.

You can find `Max` mostly in Open-Source land which is the real world.
Learning, working in the community, sharing experiences and collaborating on GitHub is what `Max` has done in recent years.

`Beast` is one of Max's good friends and `John` showed `Max` some special views from OSS.

A **teacher** at heart, I had been fortunate enough to pass what little I know to many people, thanks to my professional and **volunteer** activity. Interested in both corporate and start-up work experiences.

### Graphic Designer :us: :man:

- [Harley A](https://www.upwork.com/fl/harleya)

As a relative newcomer to graphic design, I have some limitations, but I think I have some talent too. You wonâ€™t catch me doing videos or anything that requires coding, but I love creating attention grabbing designs. 

I can do some basic 3D work, or effects, but mostly youâ€™ll see flat design and some very basic cell shading. I think Iâ€™m pretty good at color and layout. **Logos**, **posters**, **flyers**, **banners**, photo editing, etc. are my thing and I achieve some success through **LOTS of communication**. My clients help me to succeed thank you. 

It might be worth mentioning that I use software from **Serif Software** in the UK, their older apps and their new line of Affinity Design and Affinity Photo. This means I can output most of the formats you might need if they are not too publisher dependent. 

You can find me at the PC periodically throughout the day and night, about six days a week, right here in Arizona.
